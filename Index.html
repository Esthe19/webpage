<p>Tip1The first thing you need to know is that dogs when they first arrive don't expect them to come to you. Give them some space the next day try to go closer to them and let them sniff your hand and slowly pet them if they are not moving around and put treats around the house for them to follow. 
Tip 2 Dogs love belly rubs if they turn around allowing you to belly rub them that means they trust you
Tip 3 Walking is the dogs' favorite activity when walking brings treats for them to even enjoy the walking and the treats.
